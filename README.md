# 🚀 Atomic AI

**Atomic AI** is an application developed to **study and implement AI model integration**, focusing on **technical learning** rather than product innovation. The app allows users to **generate images and text**, working similarly to **ChatGPT**.

Two AI models were integrated:

- 🖼️ **DALL·E (OpenAI)** — used for image generation, aligned with OpenAI’s mission of **making AI useful for everyone**.  
- 🧠 **Sabiá-3 (Maritaca AI)** — a **Brazilian language model** known for its **excellent performance** and **easy integration**.

### 🧩 Technologies Used
- **Backend:** Node.js + TypeScript  
- **Frontend:** React Native + TypeScript  

### 💻 Development
The entire development process — from **architecture design** to **AI API integration** — was carried out **individually**, reinforcing full stack development skills and practical experience in **AI integration for mobile applications**.
